    "1": "<h3>The Unaware User</h3><p>You have minimal understanding of online identity. You rely on weak authentication methods and centralized platforms without concern for your digital security. Concepts like cryptographic proofs or decentralized identity management are unfamiliar to you.</p>",
    "2": "<h3>The Basic User</h3><p>You have some awareness of online identity but don't prioritize it. You use stronger passwords or basic 2FA, but you're not familiar with decentralized identity management or cryptographic keys. You generally trust third parties to manage your credentials.</p>",
    "3": "<h3>The Intermediate User</h3><p>You have a good understanding of online identity, using strong passwords and enabling 2FA. You are aware of decentralized identity and cryptographic proofs but may not actively implement them in your daily practices. You manage your credentials but still rely on some centralized systems.</p>",
    "4": "<h3>The Advanced User</h3><p>You are well-versed in online identity management. You use decentralized methods for identity verification, regularly manage your credentials, and understand the importance of cryptographic proofs. You take control of your identity, ensuring security at every level, though you may still rely on some trusted third parties for convenience.</p>",
    "5": "<h3>The Identity Expert</h3><p>You have a deep understanding of online identity and manage all aspects of it with precision. You actively ensure that your identity remains decentralized, use cryptographic methods for verification, and maintain full control over your credentials. You continuously audit your identity to ensure no vulnerabilities exist, avoiding third-party reliance whenever possible.</p>"
